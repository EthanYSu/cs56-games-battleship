A) A player chooses 5 different sized ships, and then places those ships on a grid, which will be hidden to 
the other player/computer. The players then take turns guessing the coordinates of the competitor's ships, until someone
"hits" all of the other person's ships.

B)  As a user, I can host a game so that another player can join using my IP address.
    As a user, I can enter the IP address of another computer that is a hosting a game so that I can play against them.
    As a user, I can play a game against the computer so that I do not need to wait for another player.
    As a user, I can select the color of my ships when playing against the computer.
    As a user, I can choose the 1D size (between 2 and 9) of 5 different ships when playing against the computer.
    As a user, I can select among three different difficulty levels when playing against the computer. 
    As a user, I can select where on my grid to place my ships so that my competitor will not know.
    As a user, I can change the orientation of my ships using the arrow keys to increase difficulty for my competitor.
    As a user, I can guess a coordinate of my opponent's grid, and receive feedback on whether I hit or missed a ship.

c) The software runs well. The IP connection works, and playing against the computer works. Unable to test sound due to 
    lack of speakers.
    
d) As a user, I would like to have a back button when setting up a game so that I can fix mistakes.
    As a user, I would like to be able to exit a game and return to the home page.
    As a user, I would like to have better visuals for the ships.
    As a user, I would like a tally for how many boats my opponent and I have sunk.
    As a programmer, I would like to edit the IP address that is displayed to remove everything after the colon
    so that it is easier for a user to join a game with another player.
    
e) The README.md is of good quality. It is easy to understand, and covers all the information you need to know.

f) The build.xml file is in pretty good shape. Each target has an accurate description. The only issue with this file is that the test target is supposed to run a test file that does not exist.

g) There are plenty of issues for this project, as well as issues that we have come up with ourselves. It is definitely possible to accumulate 1000 points with these issues.

h) Added issues:

i) There are 5 classes that compose this project. BattleshipGUI.java creates the GUI with which the user can interact with. BattleshipController.java is what calls for a new GUI to be created upon running the project. It also generates the appropriate game type based on what the user selected through the GUI. After calling the correct game type method, the controller class creates the Player object (represented by the Player class), and also a Computer object (if the user selected to play a computer). The Computer class extends the Player class (since a Computer is-A player), providing additional, computer-specific methods. These methods depend on an instance of the GuessGenerator class to "play" and make decisions for the Computer object. The organization of these classes and the general design of this project is intuitive, descriptive through abundant commentation, and easy to understand.

j) There is very little test coverage. The only testing is in the BattleShipGUI class, which tests to see if the objects are created correctly upon running the main method. Junit is not utilized at all. In the build.xml file, it is supposed to run a file (Test.java) that does not exist. There is an issues specifically dedicated to adding test coverage. This would mean implementing unit tests with JUnit.
